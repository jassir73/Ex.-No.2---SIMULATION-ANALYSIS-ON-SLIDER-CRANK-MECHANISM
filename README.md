# Ex. No.  - SIMULATION ANALYSIS ON SLIDER CRANK MECHANISM

## DATE: 03/12/2024

## AIM:
###   To determine & simulate the displacement & velocity analysis for the given slider crank mechanism. 
###   An engine mechanism is shown. The Crank CB = 200mm and the connecting rod BA = 600mm. In the position shown, the crankshaft has a speed of 50 rad/s and an angular acceleration of 800 rad/s2


## REQUIREMENTS:
###   ●	Mech Analyzer software.
###   ●	Processor: Minimum 1.5 GHz
###   ●	RAM: Minimum 512 MB
###   ●	Operating System: Windows XP, Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows 8 or higher.
###   ●	Dependencies: Microsoft .Net 2.0 framework
###   ●	Mini Drafter.
###   ●	Geometry instruments.

## PROCEDURE:
###  Configuration diagram
###  Assume scale 1:10
###  1. Draw a horizontal line and locate C 
###  2. At C, draw CB of length 20 mm inclined at 1200 
###  3. With B as centre, BA 60mm, draw an arc to cut the horizontal at A. Join BA to complete the configuration diagram

## Velocity diagram
###  Scale: 10 m/s = 100 mm (say) 
###  1. The fixed point C appears as a stationary point in the velocity diagram 
###  2. Draw the vector bc of length 100 mm, perpendicular to the crank CB from the configuration diagram 
###  3. At b, draw a projection line perpendicular to AB from the configuration diagram 
###  4. Draw a horizontal at c, meeting the projection from b at a. join ca to complete the velocity diagram.
